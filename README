Windows installer for the Haskell Platform.

How to make an installer
------------------------

0. Install GHC, msys, nsis and darcs (http://wiki.darcs.net/Binaries).
   Make sure that you have the special build of nsis with large strings support.
   Add $GHCDIR/mingw/bin to PATH.

1. Manually install cabal-install's dependencies: zlib, transformers,
   mtl, parsec, network, HTTP (in this order).

   (That is: download/unpack the .tar.gz, runghc Setup.hs
   configure -p/build/install; or use ghc-install.sh).

2. Manually install cabal-install

3. cabal update
   cabal install alex-$ALEX_VERSION happy-$HAPPY_VERSION

4. darcs get --lazy http://code.galois.com/darcs/haskell-platform/

5. cd haskell-platform && cabal install

   Make sure that you have library-profiling set to True and user-install set to
   False in $APPDATA/cabal/config.

   Make sure that you have glut.h and libglut32.a in $GHCDIR/{include/GL,lib}.

6. Move all stuff from $PROGRAMFILES/Haskell/{bin,lib} to
$GHCDIR/{lib/extralibs/bin,lib/extralibs}.

7. Run recache.py

8. Copy $GHCDIR to $THISDIR/files

9. Build winghci & put it into $THISDIR/files/winghci

   Don't forget the runtime library (depends on the Visual Studio version:
   usually msvcr900.dll, can be checked with dependency walker)

10. Update GHC_VERSION and PLATFORM_VERSION in Nsisfile.nsi

11. Copy $THISDIR/icons/*.ico to $THISDIR/files/icons

12. gen_files_for_nsis.py files inst.dat uninst.dat

13. Build the installer (right-click Nsisfile.nsi -> Compile NSIS Script).

14. Testing the installer

    I usually check that regex-posix and glut work.
