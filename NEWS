What's new in 2009.2.0-rc1:

    * We now use a single root directory for both GHC and extralibs
      ($PROGRAMFILES\Haskell Platform\$HP_VERSION).

    * Installed files are tracked precisely (no unsafe `rm -rf` business).

    * A new installation mode which doesn't touch the system settings or
      registry was introduced. Suggested by Claus Reinke.

    * Installer size was cut down by 50% by turning on 7z compression (thanks to
      Bulat Ziganshin for the heads-up).

    * The welcome screen is now slightly less dull.

Known issues:

    * The installer may work with restricted user accounts, but it has not been
      tested and is not officially supported.

    * glut32.dll is not included, though it probably should be.
