TODO items for the beta release:

     * Set the PATH variable (see ghc.iss)

     * Modify GHC_DIR/package.conf to point to where packages are installed.

     * Check that text messages are ok.

TODO items for the next release:

     * Do not call RMDir on the whole platform dir (unsafe, cabal-install puts
       packages there by default).

     * Bundle OpenAL redist, also probably GLUT.
