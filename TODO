* Write a script that automates things like downloading GHC/installing packages,
  so that the installer can be built by someone who isn't me.

* Apply Claus's changes from the GHC installer

* Add Express & Custom install types

* Add "Install only for the current user"

* WinGHCi should work even if GHC's location is not in the registry

* Add a way of choosing between WinGHCi and GHCi for .hs associations

* Include glut32.dll, at least optionally.

* Should we really use HKCR for file associations?

* Ensure that several versions of the Haskell Platform can coexist.

* Ensure that we play nice with WinHugs's installer and the like. Use an "Open
  with GHCi" context menu instead of associating .hs/.lhs with GHCi. Write a
  clear specification that describes what we do to system settings, place it on
  the wiki, and link to it from the download page/release notes.

* Look through Claus's message/links again and write down things that I forgot;
  maybe file some tickets.

* Branding: it would be nice to have different icons for .hs and .lhs files.

* Look at Sigbjorn's BAMSE work.
