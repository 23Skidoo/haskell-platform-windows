* Make the default HP install relocatable.

* Should we really use HKCR for file associations?

* Ensure that several versions of the Haskell Platform can coexist.

* Ensure that we play nice with WinHugs's installer and the like. Use an "Open
  with GHCi" context menu instead of associating .hs/.lhs with GHCi. Write a
  clear specification that describes what we do to system settings, place it on
  the wiki, and link to it from the download page/release notes.

* Look through Claus's message/links again and write down things that I forgot;
  maybe file some tickets.

* Write a script that automates things like downloading GHC/installing packages,
  so that the installer can be built by someone who isn't me.

* Branding: it would be nice to have icons with the new logo, also for .hs and
  .lhs files.

* Look at Sigbjorn's BAMSE work.
