TODO items for the beta release:

     * Set registry keys and associations (see ghc.iss)

     * Set the PATH variable (see ghc.iss)

     * Add uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs

     * Modify GHC_DIR/package.conf to point to where packages are installed.

     * Look through text.

Postponed TODO items:

     * Do not call RMDir on the whole platform dir (cabal-install puts packages
       there by default).

     * Bundle OpenAL redist. (?)
